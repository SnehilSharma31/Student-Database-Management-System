 	Student (Roll No, Name, Branch ID, CGPA)<br>
	University (University ID, University Name, University Location, Year of start)<br>

➥	Student can take a University ID/ Branch ID only if it is available in the University/ Branch database.<br>

➥	Display the entire  student list/ University list/  Branch List.<br>
➥	Delete all students whose CGPA<6.0 and store them in another list. They will come back to original student list if their CGPA>=6.0(Update function)<br>
➥	Display the list of students reading in KIIT University.<br>
