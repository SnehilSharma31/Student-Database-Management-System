# Student Database Management System using Linked List
Created three database using header linked 
 	Student (Roll No, Name, Branch ID, CGPA)
	University (University ID, University Name, University Location, Year of start)
	Branch (Branch ID, University ID, Branch Name)
Implement the following modules/ sub-modules using menu driven approach:
➥	Keep the Roll No, University ID and Branch ID Unique (Duplicated entry should not be allowed and prompted)
➥	Student can take a University ID/ Branch ID only if it is available in the University/ Branch database.
➥	Student Name, University Name and Branch Name should all be in Capital Letters. (If user has not entered accordingly, then the program must convert it into Capital Letters and store.)
➥	Display the entire  student list/ University list/  Branch List
➥	Delete all students whose CGPA<6.0 and store them in another list. They will come back to original student list if their CGPA>=6.0(Update function)
➥	Display the list of students reading in KIIT University
➥	ADD/ MODIFY/DELETE/UPDATE using key value in any of the database as per requirement.
➥	Display the student details who are reading at KIIT University with branch CSE.
➥	Display the list of Branches available in any given University
➥	Display the University details in ascending order of their year of starting
